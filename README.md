### To Contribute
Fork the repository on your own end, make the changes while keeping everything in sync and then submit with pull request for review

### Things to keep in mind
* After forking and downloading the files to your local device for the first time make sure to run ```npm install```
* While making changes restrict yourself to your components or files and don't bother changing others' code needlessly.
* Before commiting the changes do find the time to run ```npm run prettier``` to allow proper formatting of the code, such that others are easily able to understand it.
* For logos and icons use the .svg format and for other images use the .png or .jpg format with size under 100Kbs to allow faster loading
* Properly structure all the files, folders etc.
